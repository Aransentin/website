# [TinyVG.tech](https://tinyvg.tech/)

This repository contains the basic structure of the TinyVG website. It does not contain the downloads, specification or compiled artifacts like Wasm files.

## Design

The website is meant to be minimalistic and only have the necessary information to inform oneself about the format. It also is meant to provide people an overview over the format, get software tools and examples files so they can get started with TinyVG in an instant.

As the [benchmark results]() are not generated via CI at the moment, they are included in this repository and must be updated by hand.
